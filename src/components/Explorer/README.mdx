# Explorer

import { Canvas, Story, ArgsTable } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

Shows a collection of items in a tabular format,
allowing filtering, and performing actions on one or multiple items.
Item details can be shown in the side pane.

It is named after the Windows File Explorer, with which it
aims to have similarities.
